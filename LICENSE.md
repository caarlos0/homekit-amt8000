# The "Intelbras Documentation Sucks" License

The use of this is forbidden by anyone with any professional relationship with
Intelbras, included but not limited to:

- People that work at Intelbras
- Professionals that setup Intelbras alarm systems
- 3rd party service providers to Intelbras

This license will change once Intelbras provide a decent documentation of its
APIs, i.e., when their docs stop sucking.

If you want to use this, go to their forums and ask for proper documentation.
