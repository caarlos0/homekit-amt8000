## Configuration

This project is set up using environment variables.

Full list of them and what they are for:

```sh

# required.
HOST=192.168.207.4

# Alarm password.
# Should be the remote configuration password (usually 6 digits).
# required.
PASSWORD=123456

# Cental port.
# default: 9009.
PORT=9009

# Zones that are motion sensors.
MOTION="1,2,3"

# Zones that are contact sensors (i.e. doors, windows).
CONTACT="4,5,6"

# Zones to show the bypass switch for.
BYPASS='1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8'

# Indexed zone names.
# default: "Zone 1,Zone 2,..."
ZONE_NAMES="Kitchen door,Living Room Window"

# Partitions to arm when set stay mode.
# required.
STAY="1,2"

# Partitions to arm when set to night mode.
# required.
NIGHT="2,3"

# Partitions to arm when set to away mode.
# required.
AWAY="0"

# Siren numbers you want to be shown.
# It'll show them as a contact sensor, with Tamper and Battery status.
SIRENS="1,2"

# Repeater numbers you want to be shown.
# It'll show them as a contact sensor, with Tamper and Battery status.
REPEATERS="1,2"

# If the alarm is triggered, and you turn it off, after this amount of time the
# bridge will automatically clean the firings.
# If empty or 0, it will not automatically do that.
CLEAN_FIRINGS_AFTER=5m
```

> [!WARNING]
> the away mode of the Homekit bridge does not translate to the per-manual
> stay mode in the Intelbras alarm system, mainly because it is supper confusing.
> Instead, the alarm system here has 4 states:
>
> - Off
> - Night: arms the `$NIGHT` partitions
> - Away arms the `$AWAY` partitions
> - Home arms the `$STAY` partitions
>
> Rationale for what to do in each of them can be found
> [here](https://www.commandone.com/what-is-the-difference-between-stay-away-and-night-home-alarm-activation-modes/),
> but basically you'll want to arm all partitions on **away**, and a subset of
> partitions on **night** and **stay**, depending on your use case.
>
> For me, I created 3 partitions:
>
> 1. Inside motion sensors
> 2. Outside motion sensors
> 3. Access sensors and doors
>
> And I set it up like so:
>
> ```sh
> AWAY=0
> STAY=2
> NIGHT=2,3
> ```
>
> But, you do you. ðŸ˜„
